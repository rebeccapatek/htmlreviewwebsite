    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <h3>Provides the structure to the content appearing on a website</h3>
    <div>HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage
    </div>
    <p>Now what is a markup language you may be asking yourself? A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text. HTML allows a computer to interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements

        Hypertext is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links (also known as hyper links)</p>
    <h2>Let's Talk about elements</h2>
    <div>Html is composed of elements.  These elements structure  webpage and define its content.</div>
    <div>EX: a paragraph element.
        A paragraph element is made up of</div>
      <ol>
          <li>Opening tag (&lt;p&gt)</li>
          <li>Content (the text that you are displaying on the webpage. Ex: "Hello World!"</li>
          <li>Closing tag (&lt;p&gt)</li>
      </ol> 
      <p>So basically the HTML element is a unit of content in an HTML document formed by the HTML tags and the text or media that it contains.</p> 
      <p>The body element is a key HTML element used to build a webpage.  Only content inside the opening and closing body tags can be displayed on the screen. (although some browsers do accommodate for code outside the body element.

        So usually most of the code on your screen is nested in the body element.</p>
