    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <h3>Provides the structure to the content appearing on a website</h3>
    <div>HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage
    </div>
    <p>Now what is a markup language you may be asking yourself? A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text. HTML allows a computer to interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements

        Hypertext is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links (also known as hyper links)</p>
    <h2>Let's Talk about elements</h2>
    <div>Html is composed of elements.  These elements structure  webpage and define its content.</div>
    <div>EX: a paragraph element.
        A paragraph element is made up of</div>
      <ol>
          <li>Opening tag (&lt;p&gt)</li>
          <li>Content (the text that you are displaying on the webpage. Ex: "Hello World!"</li>
          <li>Closing tag (&lt;p&gt)</li>
      </ol> 
      <p>So basically the HTML element is a unit of content in an HTML document formed by the HTML tags and the text or media that it contains.</p> 
      <p>The body element is a key HTML element used to build a webpage.  Only content inside the opening and closing body tags can be displayed on the screen. (although some browsers do accommodate for code outside the body element.

        So usually most of the code on your screen is nested in the body element.</p>
    <h2>Let's talk about Structure</h2>
    <p>When an element is contained inside of another element, it is considered the child of that element.  So for example if you have a paragraph tag with content inside of a body element, then you would say that the paragraph is considered the "child" of the "parent" body element.  You could also say that it is nested in the parent element.</p>

    <p>For readability, it is common practice to add two spaces of indentation for the child of a parent element.</p>
    <p>There can be multiple levels of nesting (grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc.) The relationship between elements and their ancestors is known as <strong>hierarchy</strong>.</p>
    <p>One of the reasons that understanding the HTML hierarchy is important, is because the child elements can inherit behavior and styling from their parent element.</p>
    <h4>Here's an example:</h4>
    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;body&gt;</div>
    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</div>
    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</div>
    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;  &lt;/body&gt;</div>
    <p>Both the header and the paragraph would be considered children of the body, while the h1 and p would also be considered siblings.
    </p>
    <h2>Let's talk about the div tag</h2>
    <p>A div is another important element in HTML.  Div stands for division and they are defined as a container that divides the page into Section. These are very useful for grouping elements in your HTML together.
        Divs don't inherently have a visual representation, but when we want to apply custom styles using CSS to our elements, divs allow us to group the HTML elements and apply the same styles for all HTML elements inside.</p>
    <p>Attributes are a way to expand an element's tag.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>These are content added to the opening tag of an element.</li>
        <li>These can be used to provide information or to change styling.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Attributes have two parts</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The name of the attribute. (ex: id)</li>
        <li>The value of the attribute. (ex: "intro")</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>So here's what a div would look like with this attribute:</h4>
    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;div&gt; id="intro"></div>
    <div> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;</div>
    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;  &lt;/div&gt;</div>
    <h2>Displaying text in HTML</h2>
    <p>Paragraph or span are two common tags</p>
    <ul>
        <li>paragraphs contain a block of plain text.</li>
        <li>span contains short pieces of text or other HTML (is an inline element).  They are used to separate small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>BLOCK-LINE ELEMENTS have a line break before and after them. div and p examples. BLOCK LINE ELEMENTS will take up the entire width of the its containing element.  By default, &lt;div&gt; or &lt;p&gt; will push sibling elements to a new line or section of the page. One difference with div is that it will not skip a line</h3>
    <h3>INLINE ELEMENTS are inside a sentence or paragraph. Span tags are an example.
        INLINE ELEMENTS are a more conservative use of space. They only take up as much space as they need and will not force surrounding content to a new line.</h3>
    <div>span tags are great when you want to make one word bold, italic, a different color.</div>
    <h3>There are a few HTML tags that style the text.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>&lt;em&gt; This is short for emphasis.  It will italicize the text within this tag</li>
        <li>&lt;strong&gt; will make the text bold.</li>
        <li>&lt;br&gt; is the line break element in HTML.  It is different from the other tags in that it is only composed of a starting tag. It will send the following text to the next line on the screen. It will not leave an empty line, but if you would like to add an empty line, just put the &lt;br&gt; twice.</li>
        <li>&lt;ul&gt; is and unordered list tag used to create a bulleted list.  The &lt;ul&gt; element should not hold raw text, rather the nested list element enclosed in &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</li>
        <li>&lt;ol&gt; is an ordered list and is used to create a numbered list. &lt;ol&gt; would have to have the list elements nested as &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>&lt;em&gt; is the image tag that allows you to add an image to a webpage. The image tag is a self-closing tag so that the end of the image tags has a forward slash.</p>
    <p>The image tag has a required attribute src (stands for source) and must be set to the images source or the location of the image.  In some cases, the value of src must be a URL.URL stands for <strong>U</strong>niversal <strong>R</strong>esource <strong>L</strong>ocator.</p>
    <p>It is important to use the alt attribute when putting an image on your website .  This should be a description of the image.  Here are the purposes of the alt attribute:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If an image fails to load on the webpage, then the user can mouse over the area originally intended for the image and read a brief description of what was meant to be there.</li>
        <li> Visually impaired users often browse the web by using screen reading software.When you The alt attribute allows the screen reading software to read the image's description to the visually impaired user.Might be an ADA law as well?</li>
        <li>The alt attribute plays a role in SEO (stands for Search Engine Optimization) because search engines cannot see and image.  Having descriptive alt attributes can help improve the ranking of your site.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Video</h3>
    <p>Video tags require the src attribute as well.  Unlike image tags they require an opening and closing tag.</p>
    <h4>Here's and example of a video tag</h4>
    <p>&lt;video src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls&gt;
        Video not supported
        &lt;/video&gt;</p>
    <p>Video not supported will only be displayed if the video doesn't load</p>
    <p>The width and height attributes are used to set the size of the video displayed in the browser.</p>
    <p>The controls attribute instructs the browser to included basic controls: pause, play, skip.</p>
    <p>Alt tags are not supported in video. </p>
